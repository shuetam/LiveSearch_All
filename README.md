### Livesearch is a social media site which visualizes popular content in a nice user-friendly way. Users can collect data that interests them and share it with one another in public folders.

### The data is represented by icons whose content is displayed using iframe links.

There are three types of icons that can be collected by users:
- Movies icons
- Images icons
- Spotify icons

All of them can be placed together on a desktop area to make them easy to find and edit.
